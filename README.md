# Learning
This is a repository where I put together various snippets of code and  projects that help demonstate fundamental components of computer science. 

Many of these are pieces of code I originally took from elsewhere and modified as I worked with them and learned working through them. Others are originally authored by myself. I did my best where possible to give credit to any original authors! I do not intend to profit from this repo, just share what I've learned and organize the knowledge somewhere centralized. 

Enjoy! :D
