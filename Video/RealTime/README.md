# Real-Time Video 
You can use this code to learn about processing video being streamed live, using python and opencv.
Attach a camera to a raspberry pi like shown below. You can test if it's working by using `raspistill` to snap images.

To send video, run the `streamer.py` file and when a client connects the code will be broadcasting a live feed. On your own computer, run `client.py` to view the feed. Additionally, you can try some of the filters which will affect how the live video is rendered.
